SLOODLE Development Tools
Edmund Edgar, 2012-05-19

This repo contains tools used in creating and managing SLOODLE, a free and open source project which integrates the multi-user virtual environments of Second Life and/or OpenSim with the Moodle learning-management system.

It would normally only be useful for people developing the project.

See http://www.sloodle.org for more information about SLOODLE, and post any questions or comments in the forums there.
